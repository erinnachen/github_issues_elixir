# Github Issues in Elixir
This project will fetch issues from a repository via the Github API, and return these issues sorted, filtered, and nicely formatted. This follows the project as described in Chapter 13 of [Programming Elixir](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Elixir-1-2-Functional-Concurrent/dp/1680501666/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458915206&sr=8-1&keywords=programming+elixir).


## Installation

<!-- If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add github_issues_elixir to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:github_issues_elixir, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure github_issues_elixir is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:github_issues_elixir]]
        end
 -->
